                  "content": "2026 will be defined by three trends that move AI beyond personal productivity, says Kevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer at Writer, an enterprise AI platform for agentic work.\n\n“First, AI is shifting from individual usage to team and workflow orchestration,” Chung told _IBM Think_. That means coordinating entire workflows, connecting data across departments and moving projects from idea to completion.\n\nSecond, as reasoning capabilities improve, systems won’t just follow instructions: they’ll anticipate needs. “This evolution transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator capable of meaningful problem-solving and decision-making,” he said. [...] Generative models need to be multisensory so they can interpret the world like humans and even detect signals we might miss, said Aaron Baughman, IBM Fellow and Master Inventor, in a recent episode of _Mixture of Experts_.\n\nBaughman has worked with multimodal AI in sports and leads some of IBM’s work with the US Open, ESPN Fantasy Football and the Masters, notably. For him, multimodal AI is a trend he expects to see more of in 2026.\n\n“These models will be able to perceive and act in a world much more like a human. They’ll be able to bridge language, vision and action, all together,” he said. “In the near future, we’re to start seeing these multimodal digital workers that can autonomously complete these different tasks to interpret things, maybe even like complex healthcare cases.” [...] Finally, Chung sees the most exciting shift: the democratization of AI agent creation. “The ability to design and deploy intelligent agents is moving beyond developers into the hands of everyday business users,” he explained. “By lowering the technical barriers, organizations will see a wave of innovation driven by people closest to real problems.”\n\n### AI will move from tool to teammate in engineering and IT |Ismael Faro, VP Quantum and AI, IBM Research",

After years of headlines, investment and experimentation, the mood is shifting: innovation theatre is giving way to a more mature focus on real, practical deployment. This year will be defined by integration rather than invention, weaving AI into the fabric of organizations and delivering measurable value.\n\n\"We're also moving beyond the idea that scale alone guarantees progress. Yes, large models matter, but the future is hybrid: combining foundation models with classical AI, simulations, engineering models and world models to keep systems grounded in reality. [...] Matt Martin, CEO and co-founder, Clockwise: \"In 2026, the workplace agents that gain the most traction will be the ones that can work alongside multiple people as a team. Most AI tools today are single-player, and collaborative workflows remain underdeveloped. But most work happens in group settings: in Slack channels, in Google Docs with comments, across multiple people working on problems over time. The agents that succeed will be built for that reality, functioning more like teammates than personal assistants.\"\n\n### 9. Human culture will make or break the agentic future [...] ### 9.

As organizations accelerate toward increasingly autonomous systems, it will become clear that technology alone isn't the differentiator, people are.

These are not merely productivity tools but “digital employees” capable of negotiating with other agents, managing operational workflows, and executing complex sequences like supply chain reordering or full-stack code deployment. [...] The winners of 2026 are vertical AI platforms that wrap commoditized models in highly specific, defensible workflows, such as proprietary interfaces for legal discovery, medical triage, or code refactoring that inject context so perfectly that the user never has to prompt. Being an “AI Wrapper” was once a derogatory term, but such companies now have the most valuable business model, provided their wrapper solves the “Last Mile” problem of usability that raw models cannot.\n\nHistory shows this pattern: when a technology commoditizes (like PC hardware in the 90s or Cloud Storage in the 2010s), the economic value shifts to the design and application layer. [...] By late 2026, the winning image tools will look less like chat and more like Photoshop with good usability: layers, selections, constraints, history, and exportable variants; all powered by a model that understands what each pixel is for.\n\n[Prediction 14] The Two-Tier AI World\n\nA stark Cognitive Class Systemis emerging in the workforce, defined not by education, but by subscription tiers.

The ultimate measure of AI success will shift towards its capacity for autonomous task completion, a capability significantly enhanced by the proliferation of multi-agent systems.\n\n## Key Trends in AI Engineering Frameworks\n\nSeveral key trends are shaping the development and adoption of AI engineering frameworks in 2026:\n\n*   **Collaborative and Hybrid Architectures:** Frameworks will increasingly support collaboration between different AI models and systems, moving away from monolithic structures. Hybrid approaches, combining symbolic AI with deep learning, will become more common, allowing for more robust and interpretable AI solutions.\n*   **Modularity and Reusability:** Emphasis will be placed on creating modular AI components that can be easily assembled, tested, and deployed. This modularity will accelerate development cycles and improve the maintainability of AI systems.\n*   **Enhanced Observability:** As AI systems become more complex, the need for deep observability will grow. Frameworks will integrate advanced monitoring and logging capabilities to provide insights into model behavior, performance, and potential biases.\n*   **Robust Governance and Compliance:** With AI becoming more integrated into critical applications, governance and compliance will be paramount. Frameworks will incorporate features for ethical AI development, bias detection, explainability, and adherence to regulatory standards.\n\n## The Rise of Autonomous Task Completion\n\nA central theme in AI engineering for 2026 is the drive towards **autonomous task completion**. AI systems will be designed not just to assist humans, but to independently identify, plan, and execute complex tasks. This will be largely enabled by advancements in:\n\n*   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):** The development and deployment of MAS will be crucial. These systems, composed of multiple interacting AI agents, can tackle problems that are too large or complex for a single agent. MAS frameworks will facilitate coordination, communication, and negotiation among agents to achieve common goals.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning and Self-Improvement:** Advanced reinforcement learning techniques will allow AI systems to learn from experience and continuously improve their performance without explicit human intervention, further bolstering autonomous capabilities.\n\n## Implications for AI Engineering\n\nThe shift towards these advanced frameworks and the focus on autonomous task completion will necessitate a re-skilling of AI engineers. There will be a greater demand for expertise in areas such as distributed systems, multi-agent coordination, ethical AI, and advanced MLOps practices. The successful implementation of these frameworks will pave the way for AI to deliver more significant value across various industries by enabling automated decision-making and complex problem-solving at scale.",

              "draft": "# AI Engineering Frameworks in 2026: A Hybrid Approach to Customization, Collaboration, and Lifecycle Management\n\nIn 2026, AI engineering is increasingly defined by a hybrid approach, blending the flexibility of code-first frameworks with the accessibility of visual/low-code platforms to streamline development, deployment, and governance. This evolution is driven by the need for both deep customization and efficient collaboration in managing the AI model lifecycle.\n\n## Key Framework Categories in 2026\n\nThe AI engineering landscape in 2026 is characterized by several interconnected categories of frameworks:\n\n*   **Code-First Frameworks for Customization:** These platforms offer developers granular control and flexibility, essential for bespoke AI solutions. Examples include:\n    *   **LangChain:** Widely adopted for building complex applications powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling sophisticated chaining of LLM calls with other components. Its modular design allows developers to integrate various data sources and execution logic.\n    *   **AutoGen:** Facilitates the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. This promotes autonomous and collaborative problem-solving, allowing agents to delegate tasks and iterate on solutions.\n\n*   **Visual/Low-Code Platforms for Collaboration:** These frameworks democratize AI development by providing intuitive interfaces for building, managing, and deploying AI applications, fostering collaboration among teams with diverse skill sets.\n    *   **Dify:** Offers a user-friendly interface for building AI applications, abstracting away much of the underlying complexity and enabling faster prototyping and deployment.\n    *   **CrewAI:** Focuses on orchestrating autonomous AI agents, providing a framework for defining agent roles, goals, and communication protocols to tackle complex workflows.\n    *   **Vellum:** A platform designed for fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying LLM-based applications, emphasizing streamlined workflows and performance management.\n\n*   **MLOps Platforms for Lifecycle Management:** Essential for the end-to-end management of AI models, these platforms ensure robust deployment, monitoring, and scaling.\n    *   **Amazon SageMaker:** A comprehensive suite of tools for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale, offering features for data labeling, model tuning, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).\n    *   **Databricks:** Provides a unified platform for data engineering, machine learning, and analytics, with strong MLOps capabilities for managing the entire model lifecycle, from data preparation to production deployment and monitoring.\n\n*   **Feature Stores for Engineering and Management:** As AI models become more data-intensive, dedicated feature stores are critical for efficient feature engineering, management, and serving.\n    *   **Tecton:** An enterprise feature store that enables the creation and serving of production machine learning features, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy.\n    *   **Hopsworks:** Offers an integrated platform with a feature store, emphasizing collaboration and governance for data science teams.\n\n## Supporting Trends and Functionalities\n\nThese frameworks collectively support key trends in AI engineering:\n\n*   **Modularity and Reusability:** Code-first frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen achieve modularity through agent-based architectures and composable components, allowing developers to build complex systems from smaller, independent parts. Visual platforms like Dify and CrewAI offer visual interfaces to assemble pre-built modules and define workflows, promoting rapid development.\n*   **Collaboration and Autonomy:** AutoGen and CrewAI directly address multi-agent collaboration, enabling AI systems to work together. Visual platforms facilitate team collaboration by providing shared environments and intuitive interfaces. This move towards autonomous task completion is a significant driver for these agent-based frameworks.\n*   **Streamlined Governance and Lifecycle Management:** MLOps platforms like SageMaker and Databricks provide crucial governance features, including model versioning, access control, audit trails, and monitoring for drift and bias. Feature stores like Tecton and Hopsworks ensure feature consistency and quality, which are vital for model reliability and compliance.\n\n## Driving Companies and Ecosystem\n\nThe development and adoption of these frameworks are influenced by major cloud providers and specialized AI companies:\n\n*   **Cloud Providers:** Amazon (AWS SageMaker), Microsoft (Azure Machine Learning), and Google (Vertex AI) are investing heavily in comprehensive MLOps platforms and AI services.\n*   **AI-Native Companies:** Companies like LangChain, AutoGen (Microsoft Research), Vellum, Tecton, and Databricks are at the forefront of developing specialized tools and platforms that address specific challenges in the AI lifecycle.\n*   **Open Source Community:** The active open-source communities around frameworks like LangChain and AutoGen foster rapid innovation and widespread adoption.\n\nThis dynamic ecosystem reflects a concerted effort to make AI development more efficient, collaborative, and manageable, enabling organizations to harness the full potential of AI.",

However, based on current trends and projected advancements, AI in 2026 is anticipated to be characterized by a hybrid approach, integrating the depth of code-first frameworks with the accessibility of visual/low-code platforms. This blend aims to streamline development, deployment, and governance, driven by the dual needs for deep customization and efficient collaboration across the AI model lifecycle.\n\n## Key Framework Categories in 2026\n\nThe AI engineering landscape in 2026 is projected to feature several interconnected categories of frameworks:\n\n*   **Code-First Frameworks for Customization:** These platforms are expected to remain vital for developers requiring granular control and flexibility for bespoke AI solutions.\n    *   **LangChain:** Predicted to maintain widespread adoption for building complex LLM-powered applications, enabling sophisticated chaining of LLM calls with diverse components and data sources. Its modularity allows for deep customization [1].

We’re finally moving past “prompt engineering” theater to the real work: how does AI actually know who it’s talking to and what they’re authorized to do? I’ve been deep in this on enterprise MCP infrastructure - the gap between “AI can do amazing things” and “AI can do amazing things securely, at scale, with proper identity” is where most organizations are stuck right now. The autonomy predictions are exciting but the unsexy truth is: agentic AI doesn’t scale until we solve delegated identity. Your AI teammate needs to authenticate as you, with your permissions, across your systems - and that’s a harder problem than most realize. Appreciate you naming the superuser/surface-user divide.

The dominant trends revolve around establishing robust AI governance, sophisticated context engineering, simplified model hosting, and addressing the crucial aspect of delegated identity for agentic AI.\n\n### Key Frameworks and Trends\n\n*   **AI Governance and Compliance:** A significant development in AI engineering is the growing adoption of frameworks that facilitate standardized governance. This trend is driven by the increasing need for ethical AI deployment, regulatory compliance, and responsible AI practices across industries.\n*   **Context Engineering:** The ability to effectively manage and utilize context is becoming paramount. Frameworks and methodologies for context engineering are gaining traction as they enable AI systems to better understand and respond to dynamic environments and user needs. This involves creating systems that can process and learn from vast amounts of contextual data to improve decision-making and relevance.\n*   **Simplified Model Hosting:** Enterprises are actively seeking AI platforms and frameworks that offer streamlined and integrated solutions for hosting AI models. The focus is on platforms that can be easily incorporated into existing IT infrastructures, reducing deployment complexity and accelerating time-to-market for AI applications.\n*   **Delegated Identity for Agentic AI:** A critical area of development for agentic AI is the concept of delegated identity. Frameworks that address how AI agents can securely and reliably manage identities and permissions are essential for scaling AI deployments. This is seen as a foundational element for enabling autonomous and collaborative AI systems.\n\n### Enterprise Adoption Drivers\n\nAcross the enterprise landscape, the selection of AI engineering frameworks is largely dictated by the ease of integration with current technological stacks. Solutions that offer seamless interoperability with existing systems are prioritized to minimize disruption and maximize the value derived from AI investments. The scalability of AI solutions is intrinsically linked to the progress made in establishing secure and efficient delegated identity mechanisms.",

                  "content": "2026 will be defined by three trends that move AI beyond personal productivity, says Kevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer at Writer, an enterprise AI platform for agentic work.\n\n“First, AI is shifting from individual usage to team and workflow orchestration,” Chung told _IBM Think_. That means coordinating entire workflows, connecting data across departments and moving projects from idea to completion.\n\nSecond, as reasoning capabilities improve, systems won’t just follow instructions: they’ll anticipate needs. “This evolution transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator capable of meaningful problem-solving and decision-making,” he said. [...] Generative models need to be multisensory so they can interpret the world like humans and even detect signals we might miss, said Aaron Baughman, IBM Fellow and Master Inventor, in a recent episode of _Mixture of Experts_.\n\nBaughman has worked with multimodal AI in sports and leads some of IBM’s work with the US Open, ESPN Fantasy Football and the Masters, notably. For him, multimodal AI is a trend he expects to see more of in 2026.\n\n“These models will be able to perceive and act in a world much more like a human. They’ll be able to bridge language, vision and action, all together,” he said. “In the near future, we’re to start seeing these multimodal digital workers that can autonomously complete these different tasks to interpret things, maybe even like complex healthcare cases.” [...] Finally, Chung sees the most exciting shift: the democratization of AI agent creation. “The ability to design and deploy intelligent agents is moving beyond developers into the hands of everyday business users,” he explained. “By lowering the technical barriers, organizations will see a wave of innovation driven by people closest to real problems.”\n\n### AI will move from tool to teammate in engineering and IT |Ismael Faro, VP Quantum and AI, IBM Research",

          "content": "2026 will be defined by three trends that move AI beyond personal productivity, says Kevin Chung, Chief Strategy Officer at Writer, an enterprise AI platform for agentic work.\n\n“First, AI is shifting from individual usage to team and workflow orchestration,” Chung told _IBM Think_. That means coordinating entire workflows, connecting data across departments and moving projects from idea to completion.\n\nSecond, as reasoning capabilities improve, systems won’t just follow instructions: they’ll anticipate needs. “This evolution transforms AI from a passive assistant into an active collaborator capable of meaningful problem-solving and decision-making,” he said. [...] Generative models need to be multisensory so they can interpret the world like humans and even detect signals we might miss, said Aaron Baughman, IBM Fellow and Master Inventor, in a recent episode of _Mixture of Experts_.\n\nBaughman has worked with multimodal AI in sports and leads some of IBM’s work with the US Open, ESPN Fantasy Football and the Masters, notably. For him, multimodal AI is a trend he expects to see more of in 2026.\n\n“These models will be able to perceive and act in a world much more like a human. They’ll be able to bridge language, vision and action, all together,” he said. “In the near future, we’re to start seeing these multimodal digital workers that can autonomously complete these different tasks to interpret things, maybe even like complex healthcare cases.” [...] Finally, Chung sees the most exciting shift: the democratization of AI agent creation. “The ability to design and deploy intelligent agents is moving beyond developers into the hands of everyday business users,” he explained. “By lowering the technical barriers, organizations will see a wave of innovation driven by people closest to real problems.”\n\n### AI will move from tool to teammate in engineering and IT |Ismael Faro, VP Quantum and AI, IBM Research",
