## Popular Vegan Recipes in South America

This report outlines popular vegan dishes found across South America, highlighting common ingredients and culinary trends. While comprehensive data on vegan recipe popularity is limited, an analysis suggests that several traditional dishes have well-established vegan adaptations.

### Key Vegan Dishes

*   **Moqueca:** A traditional Brazilian stew, moqueca, can be prepared in a vegan version. Typically made with fish and shrimp, vegan moqueca substitutes these with heart of palm or other vegetables. The dish is characterized by its rich coconut milk base, tomatoes, onions, and peppers, seasoned with dendê oil (palm oil) and fresh herbs.
*   **Empanadas:** These savory pastries are popular throughout South America, with numerous vegan fillings available. Common vegan fillings include seasoned black beans, corn, potatoes, and vegetables, all encased in a baked or fried dough.
*   **Ceviche:** Traditionally made with raw fish cured in citrus juices, vegan ceviche often uses hearts of palm, mushrooms, or firm tofu as a substitute. The core flavors of lime juice, chili, cilantro, and red onion remain central to the dish.

### Common Ingredients and Culinary Trends

Several ingredients feature prominently in South American vegan cuisine:

*   **Black Beans:** A staple in many Latin American diets, black beans are a versatile protein source used in vegan empanadas, stews, and as a side dish.

Brazilian cuisine appears to hold a prominent position in the popularity of these vegan adaptations, likely due to its diverse ingredients and established culinary traditions.
