### Step 2: 📊 ANALYST

**Analysis Summary:**
The Boca Juniors transfer market for the 2025-2026 season is characterized by a significant squad overhaul planned for January 2026, involving numerous player departures through loans and free transfers.

The club also harbors ambitions for high-profile 'Galáctico' signings like Paulo Dybala and Marco Verratti, though the feasibility of these moves remains uncertain.
